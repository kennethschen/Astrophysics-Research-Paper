A research paper proposing a new mathematical method (inverse Lanczos interpolation) to create continuous 2D cosmic dust maps from discrete, scattered observations, allowing astronomers to correct for the effects of dust extinction when taking galactic measurements in unexplored regions. The paper compares the new method to local optimization using 2D polynomial fitting.

The repository contains the code needed to recreate the figures and results presented in this paper.

This project was completed in Fall 2018 with the help of Dr. Douglas Finkbeiner, Professor of Astronomy and Physics at Harvard University, with collaborators Stephen Slater and Zizheng Xu.
